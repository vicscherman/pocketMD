# **Hello Victor!**

Welcome to your PocketMD tech challenge!

We're thrilled to have you take this task!

This will help you better understand the stack that we use and will be the first step for us to understand your technical knowledge.

## **Quick Start**

To run locally the below command:

```
git clone git@github.com:PocketMD/pmd-tc-fe-vs.git && cd pmd-tc-fe-vs && yarn && yarn dev
```

## **The task**

### Summary

Your task is to build a simple multi-step (3 steps) form using [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/api/).

1. In the first step you should collect some basic information about the user (2-3 fields will do) details about the fields we'll leave up to you.
2. Second step should collect some additional information. You showed interest in trying out something with Google Places API, so in this step we should get contact details (fax number, email if available) for a specific location/place.
3. The last step should show the summary of previous 2 steps inside the `onSubmit` handler. Simple logging of the data to the console will work just fine.

The form steps should be animated (you may choose the animation style - it can be either simple fade-in and fade-out or slide-in or out, or any other approach will do).

The animation should be built out with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/).
